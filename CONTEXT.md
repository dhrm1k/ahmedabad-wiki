TASK DESCRIPTION:
Clone the design and functionality of dilli.wiki for ahmedabad.wiki using React, Supabase, and modular CSS. The site should fetch categories and places from a Supabase database, use a custom navbar and header, display category boxes in a grid, and match the visual style of dilli.wiki as closely as possible, including custom favicon and background images.

COMPLETED:
- Set up a new React app in the ahmedabad.wiki directory.
- Removed old static HTML/CSS and created React structure.
- Installed and configured Supabase client (`@supabase/supabase-js`), created `.env` for keys, and provided demo CSV data for categories and places.
- Created Supabase tables (`categories`, `places`) and explained how to set up relationships and upload data.
- Built modular React components: `Navbar`, `Header`, `Body`, `Bodybox` with corresponding CSS modules.
- Fetched categories and places from Supabase and rendered them in the UI.
- Updated the UI to closely match dilli.wiki: added a custom navbar with `atalbridge.png` as logo, set favicon to `atalbridge_favicon.ico`, and used `Riverfront_Ahmedabad_Wikimedia.jpg` as the header background.
- Adjusted font sizes and header height for better visual balance.
- Centered the grid of category boxes with appropriate margins.
- Added a footer credit linking to @dhrm1k on X.com.
- Fixed image path issues by using inline styles for public images in React components.
- Updated Bodybox CSS for a clean, bordered, card-like appearance.
- Reverted a mistaken change to a `mailto:` link in the footer.
- Centered the category boxes and adjusted their container width for better layout.

PENDING:
- Fine-tune the grid layout and responsiveness if further adjustments are needed.
- Any additional UI tweaks or new features as requested.
